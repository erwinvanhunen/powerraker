# PowerRaker : PowerShell Cmdlets for Klipper based 3D Printers

This is a ongoing side project of me where I build cmdlets for [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) based 3D printers.

It's work in progress and currently only has been tested on a Klipper based Creality Ender 3 (V1) and a Creality K1C (rooted).
